Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to virtually any field that generates or uses data. One excellent example is **Healthcare and Medicine**:

**Application**: Predictive analytics for patient care
- **Data Sources**: Electronic health records, medical imaging, wearable devices, lab results, patient demographics
- **Techniques**: Machine learning, deep learning, statistical analysis
- **Examples**: 
  - Predicting patient readmission risk within 30 days
  - Early detection of diseases through medical imaging analysis
  - Personalized treatment recommendations based on patient history
  - Drug discovery and development through molecular data analysis
  - Real-time monitoring of patient vital signs to detect anomalies

**Impact**: This application can improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and enable more personalized medicine by leveraging vast amounts of medical data to make data-driven decisions about patient care.
