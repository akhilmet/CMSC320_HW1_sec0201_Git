Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a powerful version control system that offers several key benefits:
1. **Version Control**: Track changes to files over time, allowing you to see what changed, when, and by whom
2. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts
3. **Backup and Recovery**: Complete history of all changes, making it easy to revert to previous versions
4. **Branching and Merging**: Create separate branches for features or experiments without affecting the main codebase
5. **Distributed Development**: Each developer has a complete copy of the repository, enabling offline work
6. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with platforms like GitHub for code sharing and collaboration
7. **Non-linear Development**: Support for complex workflows with multiple parallel development streams

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to virtually any field that generates or uses data. One excellent example is **Healthcare and Medicine**:

**Application**: Predictive analytics for patient care
- **Data Sources**: Electronic health records, medical imaging, wearable devices, lab results, patient demographics
- **Techniques**: Machine learning, deep learning, statistical analysis
- **Examples**: 
  - Predicting patient readmission risk within 30 days
  - Early detection of diseases through medical imaging analysis
  - Personalized treatment recommendations based on patient history
  - Drug discovery and development through molecular data analysis
  - Real-time monitoring of patient vital signs to detect anomalies

**Impact**: This application can improve patient outcomes, reduce healthcare costs, and enable more personalized medicine by leveraging vast amounts of medical data to make data-driven decisions about patient care.
