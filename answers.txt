Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science can be applied to healthcare. For example, hospitals can use patient data to predict which patients might need to be readmitted, helping doctors provide better care.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I'm looking forward to learning data science skills, working on hands-on projects, and building a portfolio for my future career.
