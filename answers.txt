Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a powerful version control system that offers several key benefits:
1. **Version Control**: Track changes to files over time, allowing you to see what changed, when, and by whom
2. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts
3. **Backup and Recovery**: Complete history of all changes, making it easy to revert to previous versions
4. **Branching and Merging**: Create separate branches for features or experiments without affecting the main codebase
5. **Distributed Development**: Each developer has a complete copy of the repository, enabling offline work
6. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with platforms like GitHub for code sharing and collaboration
7. **Non-linear Development**: Support for complex workflows with multiple parallel development streams
